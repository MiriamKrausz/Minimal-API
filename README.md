# Minimal API Project

The Minimal API project is designed to provide a solution for developing small and focused APIs without writing extensive code around it.

In a world where Microservices architecture is gaining more and more popularity, often we want to write a lightweight service containing minimal code.

To facilitate quick and hassle-free development, Microsoft offers the option to write APIs with minimal code, even without splitting into separate code files.

## Dotnet CLI

As part of the upgrade to .NET Core, which made .NET cross-platform and opened it up to the non-Windows world, Microsoft developed Dotnet CLI. This command-line interface allows performing all necessary actions via the command line, not just through Visual Studio.

With Dotnet CLI, developers who use different development tools and environments can also comfortably develop .NET applications, without relying on Visual Studio.

In this project, we'll use Visual Studio Code as our code editor.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK installed
- Visual Studio Code (or any preferred code editor)

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Run `dotnet run` command in the terminal to start the API.
4. Access the API endpoints through `https://localhost:<port>/`.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single file `Program.cs`, where all the API code resides. This minimalist approach streamlines development and maintenance, making it ideal for small-scale projects.
